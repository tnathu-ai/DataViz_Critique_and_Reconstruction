### Assessment declaration checklist

Please carefully read the statements below and check each box if you agree with the declaration. If you do not check all boxes, your assignment will not be marked. If you make a false declaration on any of these points, you may be investigated for academic misconduct. Students found to have breached academic integrity may receive official warnings and/or serious academic penalties. Please read more about academic integrity [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/academic-integrity). If you are unsure about any of these points or feel your assessment might breach academic integrity, please contact your course coordinator for support. It is important that you DO NOT submit any assessment until you can complete the declaration truthfully. 

**By checking the boxes below, I declare the following:**

## Deconstruct

### Original

The original data visualisation selected for the assignment was as follows:

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/original_image.png" width="80%">
</center>
<center>*Figure 1. Original Visualization. Source: [informationisbeautiful.net](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/antibiotic-resistance/) (July 2014).*</center>
<br>


### Objective and Audience

The objective and audience of the original data visualisation chosen can be summarised as follows: 

**Objective**
The original visualisation, titled "The Antibiotic Abacus", is designed to showcase the resistance of various bacteria to different antibiotics and antibiotic families. The aim of this study is two-fold:
1. To provide an effective visualization that educates the general public about the dangers of excessive antibiotic use.
2. To offer infectious disease doctors a quick yet comprehensive overview of antibiotic resistance in commonly encountered bacteria.

**Audience**

Given that the original visualisation is published on a visualisation-focused site, the main audience is the general public, especially those interested in understanding antibiotic resistance patterns. The visualisation does reference credible sources like the Centre for Disease Dynamics, World Health Organisation, and CDC. Such platforms typically target a wide demographic, ranging from enthusiasts who appreciate well-crafted data visualisations to individuals simply seeking to understand complex topics in a more accessible manner. 

### Critique

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

##### Overwhelming Complexity:
+ Cluttered Display: The visualisation is densely populated with data, labels, and colours, potentially confusing viewers. Inconsistent circle area may mislead viewers. The visualisation must be improved to convey the relative importance due to non-uniform scales.

##### Perceptual Issues:
The pink and purple choices are problematic for those with certain colour blindness (Red-Blind/Protanopia and Monochromacy/Achromatopsia). Also, scattered small text annotations hinder quick understanding.Varying circle sizes and overlaps misrepresent data. Shading and density variations are not optimised. Different scales for bacteria and antibiotics hinder direct comparisons.

#### Audience Consideration: Excessive detail and data points can obscure the main message for non-specialists. The distinction between individual antibiotics and antibiotic families is unclear. The line indicating "drug ineffective against bacteria" is easily misconstrued as a grid for the plot. 

## Reconstruct

### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r import}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(grid)

```

### Pre-processing

**Data:** In July 2014, the dataset on antibiotic resistance was sourced from [informationisbeautiful.net](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMSQDr0vx_NuMkbSb-9wjUCBplMZpYvxASTJh1M-NhI/edit#gid=0). We have independently verified the integrity and accuracy of this data in 2023 against original sources, including the Centre for Disease Dynamics, World Health Organisation, and CDC (US data). Subsequent data processing and formatting to generate a tailored dataframe were conducted using the R programming language.

### Reconstruction

The following plot fixes the main issues in the original.

This heatmap provides a quick visual representation of resistance percentages for various bacteria against different antibiotics. The darker the color, the higher the resistance. The antibiotics are also ordered based on their introduction dates, which can give an idea about the evolution of resistance over time.

```{r, fig.width=25, fig.height=20, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Figure 2: Antibiotic Resistance Heatmap (Sep 2023)"}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(grid)

# Melt the data frame to long format for ggplot
melted_df <- melt(antibiotic_resistance_df, id.vars = c("Bacterium_name", "Causes", "Gram_negative"))

# Ensure that the introduction dates are unique
antibiotic_intro_dates <- antibiotic_intro_dates[!duplicated(antibiotic_intro_dates$Antibiotic),]

# Create an ordered factor for the Antibiotic based on Date_introduced
antibiotic_intro_dates$Antibiotic <- factor(antibiotic_intro_dates$Antibiotic, 
                                           levels = antibiotic_intro_dates$Antibiotic[order(antibiotic_intro_dates$Date_introduced)])

# Merge the melted dataframe with the antibiotic introduction date
melted_df <- merge(melted_df, antibiotic_intro_dates, by.x = "variable", by.y = "Antibiotic", all.x = TRUE)

# Append introduction date to antibiotic name and remove underscores
melted_df$display_name <- paste(gsub("_", " ", melted_df$variable), "(", melted_df$Date_introduced, ")")

# Ensure that display_name is a factor and ordered based on variable
melted_df$display_name <- factor(melted_df$display_name, levels = unique(melted_df$display_name[order(melted_df$variable)]))

# Remove the x-axis title from the original ggplot
p <- ggplot(melted_df, aes(x = display_name, y = Bacterium_name)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = value), color = "white", width = 0.5, height = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue", name = "Resistance %") +
  labs(y = "Bacterium") +
  theme(
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 15, margin = margin(t = 10)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15, margin = margin(r = 10)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 22, margin = margin(r = 20)),
        plot.margin = margin(150, 10, 100, 10),  
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray", size = 0.25),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold")
  ) + 
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top", name = NULL)  # Remove default x-axis label here

# Display plot
print(p)

# Add the x-axis title manually using grid functions
grid::grid.text("Individual Antibiotic", x = 0.01, y = 0.77, just = c("left", "center"), gp = grid::gpar(col = "black", fontsize = 22, fontface = "bold"))

# Display the title text at the top-left of the plot
grid::grid.text("ANTIBIOTIC CHALLENGE: BACTERIAL RESISTANCE OVERVIEW", x = 0.01, y = 0.975, just = c("left", "top"), gp = grid::gpar(col = "blue", fontsize = 30, fontface = "bold"))

# Display the main source text below the plot
grid::grid.text("Sources: Centre for Disease Dynamics, World Health Organisation, CDC (US data) | Designed by Thu Tran", x = 0.01, y = 0.02, just = c("left", "bottom"), gp = grid::gpar(col = "gray", fontsize = 13, fontface = "italic"))

# Display the additional information below the main source text
grid::grid.text("Original image: informationisbeautiful.net | Data collected by July 2014", x = 0.01, y = 0.01, just = c("left", "bottom"), gp = grid::gpar(col = "gray", fontsize = 13, fontface = "italic"))

# Save the plot to a file
ggsave(filename = "../images/antibiotic_resistance_plot.png", width = 25, height = 20)

```

=> The visualisation serves as a bridge between complex data and a wide audience range, from specialists to the general public, aiming to educate them about the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance. It achieves this by showcasing a heatmap of bacterial resistance percentages for each antibiotic, contextualised with their respective introduction dates. This design choice communicates the increasing challenge of bacterial resistance to newer antibiotics.

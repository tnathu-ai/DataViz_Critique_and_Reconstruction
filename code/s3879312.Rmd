### Assessment declaration checklist

Please carefully read the statements below and check each box if you agree with the declaration. If you do not check all boxes, your assignment will not be marked. If you make a false declaration on any of these points, you may be investigated for academic misconduct. Students found to have breached academic integrity may receive official warnings and/or serious academic penalties. Please read more about academic integrity [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/academic-integrity). If you are unsure about any of these points or feel your assessment might breach academic integrity, please contact your course coordinator for support. It is important that you DO NOT submit any assessment until you can complete the declaration truthfully. 

**By checking the boxes below, I declare the following:**

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec1" name="dec1" value="Agree"> I have not impersonated, or allowed myself to be impersonated by, any person for the purposes of this assessment 

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec2" name="dec2" value="Agree"> This assessment is my original work and no part of it has been copied from any other source except where due acknowledgement is made.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec3" name="dec3" value="Agree"> No part of this assessment has been written for me by any other person except where such collaboration has been authorised by the lecturer/teacher concerned.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec4" name="dec4" value="Agree"> Where this work is being submitted for individual assessment, I declare that it is my original work and that no part has been contributed by, produced by or in conjunction with another student.

# Antibiotic Resistance: A Comprehensive Analysis 

## Statement of Purpose
The aim of this study is two-fold:
1. To provide an effective visualization that educates the general public about the dangers of excessive antibiotic use.
2. To offer infectious disease doctors a quick yet comprehensive overview of antibiotic resistance in commonly encountered bacteria.

## Introduction
The following report aims to provide a detailed understanding of a dataset concerning antibiotic resistance across various bacterial species. This topic is of growing concern in the medical and scientific community. 

---

## Columns Explained

| Column                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bacterium Name            | Scientific name of the bacteria.                                             |
| Causes                    | Diseases or conditions that the bacteria typically cause.                    |
| Gram-negative?            | Indicates whether the bacterium is Gram-negative ('yes' or 'no').            |
| Individual Drugs          | Resistance levels to specific antibiotics, represented as percentages.       |
| Remarks                   | Additional comments about antibiotic resistance.                             |
| Resistance Score          | A scale from 1-4 indicating the level of concern, with higher scores being more concerning. |
| N Antibiotics or Classes  | Number of antibiotics or classes showing at least some resistance.           |
| Average % Resistance      | Calculated average resistance score across all considered antibiotics.       |

---

## Key Highlights

### Bacterial Species of Concern

1. **A. baumanii**
    - Nicknamed "Iraqibacter"
    - High resistance to multiple antibiotics
    - Resistance score: 4

2. **E. faecium**
    - 75% resistance to a specific antibiotic
    - Average resistance: 47%

3. **N. gonorrhoeae**
    - Causes gonorrhea
    - Resistance score: 3
    - 14.35% average resistance

4. **M. tuberculosis**
    - Extremely drug-resistant variants
    - Resistance score: 3

5. **S. aureus**
    - 25.90% average resistance but to only one antibiotic class

6. **Note After 1992**
    - No major new antibiotics have been developed for over 20 years.

7. **Gram-negative Bacteria**
    - Typically more resistant due to their cell wall structure.

---

## Key Concerns

1. **Rising Resistance**: Resistance is stable or increasing for many bacteria.
2. **Multi-drug Resistance**: Resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.
3. **Gram-negative Bacteria**: More resistant and increasing so over time.
4. **Data Gaps**: Unquantified resistances could underrepresent actual resistance levels.

---

## Conclusion

This dataset serves as a snapshot that underlines the urgency for new antibiotics and effective strategies to manage antibiotic resistance. It calls for immediate action from both the medical community and policymakers.

### Objective and Audience

The objective and audience of the original data visualisation chosen can be summarised as follows: 

**Objective**

**Audience**

### Critique

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* Briefly explain issue 1: hard for common audience with no medical background to identify issues
* Briefly explain issue 2: Color blindness issues
* Briefly explain issue 3: Shapes and sizes of the circle is not unified

```
data and aesthetic mappings,
• geometric objects,
• scales, and
• facet specification.
We have also touched on two other components:
• statistical transformations, and
• the coordinate system.
```

## Reconstruct

### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
# Read and preprocess libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(writexl)

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

```

### Pre-processing

```{r}
# Comment: Read Excel data from the first sheet
data <- read_excel("../data/antibiotic_data.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# Comment: Rename Columns
# Assuming the first row has column names that need renaming
names(data) <- str_replace_all(names(data), c(" " = "_", "%" = "percent", "-" = "_"))

# Comment: Save the cleaned data into a new CSV file
write.csv(data, "../data/cleaned_antibiotic_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

data
```


```{r}

# Load data (assuming it's saved in a file called "data.csv")
df <- read.csv("../data/cleaned_antibiotic_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# Handle missing values:
# Replace "x" with NA and convert to numeric
df[df == "x"] <- NA
df[4:ncol(df)] <- lapply(df[4:ncol(df)], as.numeric)

# Handle columns:
# The first three columns seem to be about the bacterium name, its common diseases, and its gram-negative status. 
# For better clarity, we will rename them.
colnames(df)[1:3] <- c("BacteriumName", "Causes", "GramNegative")

# Removing rows that are not relevant to our analysis:
# Rows that contain only NAs or meta-information are removed.
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(BacteriumName))

# As a suggestion, you might want to separate the antibiotics based on their family/group. 
# However, this would require domain knowledge about which antibiotic belongs to which group.

# You can save the cleaned data to a new CSV file if desired.
write.csv(df, "../data/cleaned_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# The data is now cleaned and saved as "cleaned_data.csv".
df

```
